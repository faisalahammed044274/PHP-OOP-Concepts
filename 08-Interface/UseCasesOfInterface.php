Interface

    ## Interfaces are like guideline or contract.

    ## When you want to control how how a class should be defined
    then you can define some guideline using interface and ask all
    the implementation class to follow it.

    ## A server can implement  the code and give a interface to 
    call that methods with the required parameters.

    ## Think like WSDL or YAML or XSD are like definitions of
    how something is implemented. XML are like Class.
